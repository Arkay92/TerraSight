# TerraSight

## Overview
TerraSight is a PyTorch-based project focused on classifying satellite images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project aims to leverage advanced neural network techniques, including batch normalization, dropout regularization, data augmentation, and adaptive learning rate scheduling, to improve the accuracy of satellite image analysis for remote sensing applications.

## Features
- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Tailored for high-resolution satellite image classification.
- **Batch Normalization**: Improves model training stability and speed.
- **Dropout Regularization**: Prevents overfitting and enhances model generalization.
- **Data Augmentation**: Increases dataset diversity, further improving model robustness.
- **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling**: Optimizes the learning process for better performance.

## Installation
